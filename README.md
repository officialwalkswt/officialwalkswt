The Walks outdoor adventure tracking project is part of a Senior Computer Science Project at West Texas A&M University.
We created this application for anyone interested in planning and monitoring adventures in the great outdoors. 
Whether you want to go on an adventure, plan one for someone else, or just check in on your friends and family as they travel, 
we've put all you need in one place to make it happen.
